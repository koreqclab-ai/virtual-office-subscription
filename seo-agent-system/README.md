# SEO Competitive Analysis Agent System

A comprehensive, reusable agent swarm system for conducting in-depth SEO competitive analysis across different industries. Built for Claude Code, this system automates the entire competitive SEO analysis process from technical auditing to strategic recommendations.

## 🎯 What This System Does

Instead of manually conducting competitive SEO analysis for each client, this system allows you to simply run:

```bash
"Run SEO competitive analysis on [domain list]"
```

And automatically receive:
- ✅ Complete technical SEO audit of all competitors
- ✅ Keyword opportunity gap analysis  
- ✅ Content strategy recommendations
- ✅ Link building opportunities
- ✅ Implementation roadmap with priorities
- ✅ Ongoing monitoring framework

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from integration_workflow import SEOAgentOrchestrator

# Initialize system
orchestrator = SEOAgentOrchestrator()

# Run analysis
results = await orchestrator.execute_competitive_analysis(
    target_domain='your-client.com',
    competitors=['competitor1.com', 'competitor2.com', 'competitor3.com'],
    analysis_config={
        'execution_mode': 'hybrid',
        'industry_focus': 'virtual_office_services'
    }
)
```

**Output**: Complete analysis with standardized deliverables ready for client presentation.
